# Model-Evaluation

## Recommender Systems

Bootstrap is a statistical resampling technique that is used to estimate the quality of a model. It involves creating a large number of random samples with replacement from a dataset and using each of these samples to build and evaluate a model. By aggregating the results from each of these models, we can get a more accurate estimate of the model's performance.

In this project, we will explore the steps involved in using bootstrap to estimate the quality of a model. We will use the Python programming language and several popular libraries for data manipulation and modeling, including numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
